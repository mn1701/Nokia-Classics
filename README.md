Working with DOM, classList, events, timers of Javascript

There is some difficulty when I work on snake game since there was a few times hit the border, which is the boundaries but the snake is still alive. I need to work on the size and structure of the border to make sure when the snake hit the boundaries, the user will lose. I have also learned and practicing using spread function to copy the original snake but not modify it, and learn how to use setInterval. 

In the Memory game, it was hard to have the correct size for the container that can contains all the images that can fit the screen. Also have experience working with setTimeout, which is very useful for this Memory game.
